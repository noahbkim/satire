        <h2>Money Makes Success</h2>
        <p>
            AP courses are offered to High School students and despotic parents who are devoted to regurgitating shallow outlines of advanced material in order to build their college applications. Through these courses, we strive to promote our arbitrarily selected subject matter and provide students with an experience that has as little to do with college as academically possible. This way, they can be minimally prepared to follow up the classes they usually donâ€™t place out of anyway. The AP program is also incredibly valuable to students because it helps develop skills such as memorization of largely disconnected information, which they will find incredibly useful in situations without access to a computer, a phone, any books, or other humans, like in an insane asylum. It also improves our bottom line as a company, which is beneficial to students because we get more money.
