                <h2>AP Today</h2>
                <p>
                    AP courses are offered to High School students and despotic parents who are fascinated by regurgitating shallow outlines of advanced material for the sole purpose of building their college applications. Through these courses, we strive to promote our arbitrarily selected subject matter and provide students with an experience that has as little to do with college as academically possible. This way, they can be minimally prepared to follow up the classes they usually won't be allowed to place out of anyway.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The AP program is incredibly valuable to students because it helps develop skills such as memorization of largely disconnected information, which they will find useful in situations without access to a computer, a phone, any books, or other humans, much like in an insane asylum. It can also help accustom them to nearly cryptographically random grading systems, extremely strong curves, and scoring scales that have been reduced to minimize any actual meaning.
                </p>
                <img src="img/sad2.jpg" style="width: 85%;">
                <p>
                    But the drawbacks don't stop there. AP tests are also beneficial to schools, which have begun forcing students into taking unreasonable numbers of tests in order to garner positive attention from mainstream media for pushing challenging curriculum. This systematic, self-perpetuating silliness has truly taken wing throughout schooling on an international level, and even we're quite proud of what we've caused.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ultimately, standardized testing also improves our bottom line as a company, which is beneficial to everyone because we get more money. But if you thought we'd be satisfied at that, you'd be wrong as CRAP.
                </p>
                <h2>Introducing CRAP</h2>
                <p>
                    In order to extend our mafia-like influence even further, we're introducing a new series of standardized tests aimed at allowing students in preschool, elementary school, and middle school to place out of courses at the next scholastic level. This will be part of our re-envisioned program, named pre-Collegiate Restrictionless Advanced Placement.
                </p>

                <h2>Personalizing Education</h2>
                <p>
                    Students, especially in preschool and K-5, need to define themselves to colleges. They need to put their names on the candidate list, and to do that, they need to be able to customize their education. We firmly believe that students will always make the best decisions for themselves, so we want to give them the full spectrum of opportunities, even if most of them are bad. Our new program puts education in the hands of the students, regardless of their grade, and we're proud to be progressing academics in such a backwards-thinking way. Today, we're giving you a sneak preview of some of the new courses we're offering.

                <h3 id="ap-pre" class="dropdown down"><span class="arrow">&#x25B8;</span> &nbsp;Prekindergarten</h3>
                <ul id="ap-pre-list">
                    <li><b>Advanced Coloring</b><br>We believe every student is an aspiring artist, and with the proper
                    training, can make works rivalling those of Picasso and Monet. In advanced coloring, we want to
                    teach students the formula for being original and creative.
                    <li><b>Basic Grammar</b><br>Grammar is a subject as old as the classroom. We intend to
                    revolutionize the English learning process for Kindergarten students, who will sentence structure
                    and 2017 SAT vocabulary, which we've reduced to a more accessible set consisting of all 2-3 letter
                    words in the English Language.</li>
                    <li><b>Alphabetics</b><br>Did you know there are over 34 ways to pronounce the letter Q? No matter
                        how you look at it, there are a lot of letters in English.
                    This course will deeply familiarize students with the numerous symbols in the alphabet, as well as
                    give them advanced insights into how they can be used.</li>
                    <li><b>Advanced Napping</b><br>Napping is a lifelong skill. We're offering this class to make sure
                        all students have the opportunity to take naps. It's also a good way for them to get an early
                        start catching up on
                        sleep they'll miss in higher grades.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="ap-k" class="dropdown"><span class="arrow">&#x25B8;</span> &nbsp;Kindergarten</h3>
                <ul id="ap-k-list">
                    <li><b>Arithmetic</b><br>Arithmetic is obviously an important skill both in and outside of the
                    classroom, and we want to make sure students have as solid a foundation in the subject as possible.
                    According to our meticulous study plan, students will have only gotten to integral calculus by the end of the year.</li>
                    <li><b>Reading</b><br>What better time to start into the classics than now, when students are most curious and impressionable?
                    Not only will this course standardize how students interpret literature, it will also make sure they're exposed to a tailored list of classics,
                    including The Canterbury Tales, One Hundred Years of Solitude, Being in Time, and Atlas Shrugged.</li>
                    <li><b>Seminar in Play Time</b><br>Structured playtime is the best way to produce a child prodigy,
                    which your child undoubtedly is. In this seminar, students will keep documented logs of their social
                    interactions during off hours in order to demonstrate to colleges that they are socially adept and confident.</li>
                    <li><b>Seminar in Recess</b><br>Seminar in recess is the perfect way for students to complete their
                    kindergarten portfolio. It's a holistic approach to testing a combination of social awareness, physical
                    fitness, and several other factors, but nobody seems to actually know what it is.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="ap-e" class="dropdown"><span class="arrow">&#x25B8;</span> &nbsp;Elementary School</h3>
                <ul id="ap-e-list">
                    <li><b>Cursive</b><br>Cursive is probably the most useful skill students will ever acquire, and they'll
                    find themselves in countless situations where it's applicable to their careers.
                    Much like writing five paragraph essays, doing long division by hand, and counting the tiles in the ceiling,
                    this is a life skill.</li>
                    <li><b>Arithmetic</b><br>Here at CollegeBoard, we've never heard of computers or calculators, so
                    we think it's a good idea to test students on doing math by hand. Like most others, we grade this
                    exam primarily with a random number generator, so practice hard, but don't expect much.</li>
                    <li><b>Recorder</b><br>It's been used in symphonies by the likes Bach and Mozart. It's played battle marches
                    and national anthems. Some say it's the instrument that welcomes you at heaven's gate. The recorder
                    is one of the most beautiful instruments known to man, and through this curriculum, we hope to torture
                    every single teacher into questioning their very existence.</li>
                    <li><b>Seminar in First Crushes</b><br>Middle school is an emotionally challenging time for students.
                    To help elucidate life's mysteries, we're presenting a brand new course on dating in elementary school,
                    which includes lessons on awkwardly asking girls out and not being sure what a date is.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="ap-m" class="dropdown"><span class="arrow">&#x25B8;</span> &nbsp;Middle School</h3>
                <ul id="ap-m-list">
                    <li><b>Social Dynamics</b><br>Spending tens of hours studying alone in your room is the perfect way
                    to learn the material for this new test, which encompasses things like make eye contact while conversing,
                    common etiquette, and an advanced unit on reading the mood.</li>
                    <li><b>Second Crush</b><br>Since now is around the time when students start to have their second
                    or third crushes, we thought it'd be the perfect opportunity to give them an opportunity to also
                    demonstrate what they've learned. Which, around now, is usually not very much, especially in the way of
                    romance.</li>
                    <li><b>Being Annoying</b><br>Being annoying is the quintessential middle
                    school activity, so we want students to be able to demonstrate their talents and hopefully
                    place out of corresponding courses in high school, college, and the rest of life.</li>
                </ul>
